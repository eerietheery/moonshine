changing colors slowly kills performance, implement gpu based handling for ðŸŒˆrainbowmodeðŸŒˆ (scrolling colors)

Event Handler library? 

absolutely ensure that when the user clicks the linked aritst name from the list view it also resets the sidebar filter, sometimes I feel trapped viewing a 2 track list lol 

improve playlists tab so it shows the first four artists/albums in the thumbnail if there are that many 

Skin 2.0 - draw album art to edge of card for fuller look, list mode draw art behind text, keep text in same place tho, album art fills row

organize settings

organize fat files into smaller files

Reduce RAM usage


fix sidebar filtering disable, grid sort by album

98 context menu style match

new sort in the toolbar in the app next to List and Grid we're going to add Browse. 
Browse will load a grid of random Artists (displayed by circles) and albums (displayed by rounded squares) in scrollable side-scrolling categories 

fix logic of bit rate sort (320 kbps comes out on top)
