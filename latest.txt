**Troubleshooting Report**

**Initial Problem:** The application failed to display music lists after a UI refactoring that split a monolithic `ui.js` file into smaller modules.

**Resolution Steps:**

1.  **UI Refactoring Bug:** I first identified a `ReferenceError` in `src/ui.js`, where the `showToast` function was called before it was defined. This was resolved by reordering the functions within the file.

2.  **Default Library Loading:** The app still failed to load the default music library on startup, displaying a blank list. To fix this, I modified `src/renderer/library.js` to ensure that if the initial scan found no configured directories, it would proceed to load the system's default music folder.

3.  **Pathing Correction:** The final issue was an incorrect path format in `main.js`. The default music directory was hardcoded with forward slashes (`/`), which is incompatible with Windows' native backslash (`\`) format. This was corrected by replacing the hardcoded path with a call to `app.getPath('music')`, which provides the correct, platform-specific path.

**Outcome:** After these changes, the application now correctly loads the default music library on startup and displays the track list as expected.
