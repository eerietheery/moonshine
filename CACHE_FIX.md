# IndexedDB Cache Persistence Fix

## Problem
The IndexedDB cache was not persisting between app launches. Each time the app started, it would do a full library scan instead of loading from the cache, even though the cache was successfully saving data.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the cache detection logic in `cachedMusicScanner.js`:
1. The `hasData()` method was being used to check for cached data
2. There was insufficient error handling and logging to diagnose issues
3. The database connection wasn't properly checking its state before operations
4. No error recovery mechanisms were in place

## Changes Made

### 1. `cachedMusicScanner.js`
- **Changed cache detection**: Replaced `hasData()` with direct `count()` call
- **Added logging**: Now logs the actual count of cached tracks found
- **Better visibility**: You'll see `📦 Cache check: Found X cached tracks` on each launch

### 2. `indexedDBCache.js`

#### `open()` method improvements:
- Added check for both `this.db` AND `this.isInitialized` to prevent reopening
- Added database error handlers (`onerror`, `onclose`)
- Detects unexpected database closures and resets state
- Better logging when reusing existing connections

#### `count()` method improvements:
- Added try-catch wrapper for safety
- Returns 0 on error instead of rejecting (prevents crashes)
- Added detailed error logging for debugging
- Added transaction error handler

#### `getAllTracks()` method improvements:
- Added try-catch wrapper for safety
- Returns empty array on error (prevents crashes)
- Better error logging
- Added transaction error handler

## How It Should Work Now

### First Launch (No Cache)
```
📦 Opening IndexedDB: moonshine-cache version 1
✅ IndexedDB opened successfully
📦 Cache check: Found 0 cached tracks
📦 No cache or force full scan, scanning library...
📦 Caching 2185 tracks...
✅ Cached 2185 tracks, 0 errors
```

### Subsequent Launches (With Cache)
```
📦 Opening IndexedDB: moonshine-cache version 1
✅ IndexedDB opened successfully
📦 Cache count result: 2185
📦 Cache check: Found 2185 cached tracks
📦 Cache hit! Loading tracks from IndexedDB...
📦 Retrieved 2185 tracks from cache
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear existing cache** (if needed):
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab → IndexedDB → Delete `moonshine-cache`
   - Or run in console: `await cache.clear()`

2. **First launch test**:
   - Close and restart the app
   - Check console for "Found 0 cached tracks" → Full scan
   - Wait for scan to complete
   - Check for "Cached X tracks" message

3. **Cache persistence test**:
   - Close the app completely
   - Restart the app
   - Check console for "Found X cached tracks" where X > 0
   - Should see "Cache hit! Loading tracks from IndexedDB..."
   - Library should load in < 1 second

4. **Verify in DevTools**:
   - Open Application tab → IndexedDB → moonshine-cache → tracks
   - Should see all your tracks stored there
   - Check that data persists after app restart

## Debugging

If cache still isn't persisting, check the console for:
- `❌ Cache count error:` - Problem reading count
- `❌ Failed to retrieve tracks:` - Problem loading tracks
- `⚠️ Database connection closed unexpectedly` - Connection dropped
- `📦 Cache count result: 0` when you expect data - Database is empty

You can also manually check cache status in DevTools console:
```javascript
// Get cache stats
await cache.count()  // Should show number of tracks

// View all tracks
await cache.getAllTracks()  // Shows all cached data

// Check if cache is working
await cache.isAvailable()  // Should be true
```

## Benefits
- **Faster startup**: Cache loads in ~1 second vs 10+ seconds for full scan
- **Better reliability**: Graceful error handling prevents crashes
- **Better debugging**: Detailed logs show exactly what's happening
- **Data safety**: Cache persists between app launches
- **Automatic recovery**: Falls back to full scan if cache fails

## Next Steps
If you continue to see "Found 0 cached tracks" on subsequent launches:
1. Check if Electron is running in incognito/private mode
2. Check if IndexedDB storage is being cleared by antivirus/cleanup tools
3. Verify user data directory has write permissions
4. Check if multiple Electron instances are conflicting
